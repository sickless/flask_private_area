Description: 
        flask_private_area
        ------------------
        
        flask_private_area uses Flask-AutoIndex with a simple authentication, via
        a sqlite database.
        
        The initial goal was to keep an persistent authentication when an authenticated
        user still navigates in a private area.
        A very short expiration time cookie is used and set each time the user goes on
        a page in the private area.
        
        
Platform: any
